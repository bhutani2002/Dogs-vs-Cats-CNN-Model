# Dogs-vs-Cats-CNN-Model

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a specific type of artificial neural network that uses perceptrons, a machine learning unit algorithm, for supervised learning, to analyze data. CNNs apply to image processing, natural language processing and other kinds of cognitive tasks.

A dog vs cats dataset is taken from kaggle and using Image Data Generator and other methods all the data is maintained and flowed. A Sequential Deep Learning Model is created and is worked by upon the data. And then through the confusion matrix the output is presented. Then the same data is used upon the VGG 16 model and the results are again represented through the confusion matrix. Here the VGG 16 model, performed far better than the Sequential model we built.
